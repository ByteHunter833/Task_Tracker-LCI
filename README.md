# Task Tracker

A simple task tracker application built with Django. This project allows users to add, update, delete, and manage tasks from the command line interface (CLI). Tasks are stored in a database and can be exported to a JSON file for easy backup or transfer.

## Features

- Add, update, delete tasks
- Mark tasks as "in progress" or "done"
- List all tasks or filter tasks by their status:
  - All tasks
  - Tasks that are done
  - Tasks that are not done
  - Tasks that are in progress
- Data is stored in a Django database and saved to a JSON file
